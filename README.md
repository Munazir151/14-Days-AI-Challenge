# 🚀 Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge  
### Lakehouse, Apache Spark & AI-Ready Data Engineering

This repository contains my **hands-on implementation** of the **Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge** — a structured learning initiative focused on mastering Databricks Lakehouse fundamentals, Apache Spark analytics, modern data engineering workflows, and preparation for AI/ML solutions.

The objective of this project is to design **production-style data pipelines** on the Databricks Lakehouse platform and apply them to **large-scale e-commerce data ingestion, transformation, and analytics**.
